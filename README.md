issues

if you find an issue i would prefeer you make the issue report here
i accept issue reports on my discord server too

AL3X10MODE only has half support, if you find an issue in it i will try to fix it but if you find an issue in EIXMODE or SALTMODE that issue will be given higher priority as EixMode9 is focused on EIXMODE and SALTMODE

if you make an issue in leet speak/1337 5934k 3L173 H4%0r5 L4n6u463 it will be ignored.
only make issues in normal languages. IE: English English, American English, Canadian English, Spanish, German, Klingon (i have a klingon dictonary, i can translate it), French, Wapanese (please try not to use it), Japanese, Veitnese, or Chinese. i would prefer issues to be written in any of the 3 englishs i listed because english is my main language. i have google translate, bing translate, my sister, and my kilngon dictonary for others if your bad at english.

discord

i have a discord link as the splash message
you can hold down any button to make it stay
in order to get access to the EixMode9 channels you must type ?joinrp

why i decided to put ReiSix instead of whatever version luma is at now

Luma3ds extracts the native firm from the nand, if the native firm is missing, Luma fails to mount the ctrnand
ReiNand uses an external native firm (firmawre.bin/nativefirmware.bin) therefore, if the native firm is missing from the nand ReiNand is able to mount the nand properly
Although Luma3ds is smaller (around 80kb) and ReiSix is bigger (1.9mb) i still feel that ReiSix is better
ReiNand is currently equal, if not better than Luma3ds even though it has different features.

and if you dont understand what i mean heres a crappy simple explanation

ReiSix is first
Luma3ds is second
CakesFW is third

each one is worth 1 point
yes=1
no=0
something else=0.5
C is for the casual section, non casual section, and joke section
N is for the non casual section, and joke section
