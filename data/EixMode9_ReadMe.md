###
Bugs and problems
Report any bugs or problems you find in this to me, not
d0k3
This is a mod of GodMode9 meaning that you will not get
any support from d0k3 if you have issues
Only report bugs and issues to me, dont complain about
accidently doing something, i will ignore you if you do
that

####
Suggestions
I accept suggestions but only if they are feasible, no
write to game cart crap (i would love gamecart wrightts
too)
Please keep suggestions to a minimum though

##
ELUA crap
In using this software you cannot blame the devs of
anything related to GodMode9 by d0k3
You can also not claim "accident" when you accidently
delete a important system file
You are using this at your own risk
